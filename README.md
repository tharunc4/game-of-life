Tharun's Game of Life

# Rules
These rules, which compare the behaviour of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

1.Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.

2.Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

3.All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
